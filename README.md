# Sheets of empty canvas, untouched sheets of clay
# Were laid spread out before me, as her body once did
# All five horizons revolved around her soul, as the Earth to the Sun
# Now the air I tasted and breathed has taken a turn
# Ooh, and all I taught her was everything
# Mmm, oh, I know she gave me all that she wore
# And now my bitter hands chafe beneath the clouds
# Of what was everything
# All the pictures had all been washed in black
